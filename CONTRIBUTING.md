# CONTRIBUTING
Firstly, this package is intended to be an extension for [StadGent/laravel_site_opening-hours](https://github.com/StadGent/laravel_site_opening-hours), so if you'd like to contribute in any way to this project, it might be of use to read the documentation to that project.

That documentation can be found:
- On [Confluence](https://digipolisgent.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/OP/overview) for all functional documentation
- On [GitHub](https://github.com/StadGent/laravel_site_opening-hours/blob/develop/README.md) for the technical documentation
